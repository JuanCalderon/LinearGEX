LinearGEX is a **pre-hoc explainability framework** for short-text NLP tasks.  
It combines **q-gram tokenization**, **linear classifiers**, and a **deterministic gram-to-word tracing mechanism** to provide efficient, human-readable, and scalable token-level explanations.  

This repository contains the implementation, experimental notebooks, and supplementary materials for the manuscript:

## üöÄ Features
- **Pre-hoc interpretability**: explanations are intrinsic to the model, not post-hoc approximations.  
- **Gram-to-word tracing**: reconstructs human-readable tokens from q-gram coefficients with fidelity ($R^2 = 1$).  
- **Efficiency**: explanations in microseconds per instance, scalable to corpus-level heatmaps.  
- **Compatibility**: designed for sparse linear models (LinearSVC + TF-IDF q-grams).  
- **Visualization**: batch-level heatmaps and JSON exports for auditing, annotation, or downstream tools.

## üèóÔ∏è Prototype Architecture
The LinearGEX prototype integrates six sequential stages:

1. **Input Processing**: Raw short texts (tweets, comments) are normalized while preserving token boundaries.  
2. **Q-gram Tokenization**: Words are decomposed into overlapping character q-grams. <!-- ($q \in \{2,3,4\}$). --> 
3. **TF‚ÄìIDF Weighting**: Sparse weighting highlights informative substrings across the corpus.  
4. **Linear Estimation**: A linear model (e.g., LinearSVC) learns coefficients for each q-gram.  
5. **Deterministic Gram‚ÜíWord Tracing**: Contributions from q-grams are aggregated into word-level scores, ensuring exact reconstruction of the model margin.  
6. **Visual Explanation**: Token-level heatmaps and batch-level visualizations reveal recurrent patterns, dataset biases, or model errors.

This architecture allows **real-time, corpus-wide analysis** of explanations, something impractical for post-hoc methods like SHAP or LIME.

**Visual Explanation**: Token-level heatmaps and batch-level visualizations reveal recurrent patterns.

The figure below illustrates how LinearGEX reconstructs word-level relevance from q-grams and visualizes it in an interpretable heatmap.

## üìä Experiments
All controlled experiments reported in the paper (Section 4) can be reproduced via the notebooks in [`experiments/`](./experiments).  
They evaluate:
- **Fidelity** ($R^2$ on native outputs: margins for LinearSVC, logits for BERT, surrogate fit for LIME).  
- **Auxiliary metrics** (MAE for SHAP/LinearGEX, STD for LIME).  
- **Runtime and scalability** (per-instance time, batch size, batch runtime).  

Results are exported as CSV tables consistent with **Table 5** of the manuscript.
